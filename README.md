## ABOUT ME

Hello! I am Kalega Richard, a STEM educator, trainer, and curriculum developer with over nine years of experience teaching Physics and Mathematics at secondary school level and hands-on STEM and life skills learning in schools and community settings. My work focuses on learner-centred, inquiry-based, and project-based learning, where students learn by building, experimenting, reflecting, and improving. I am passionate about making science and technology accessible, practical, and meaningful for young people.

I advanced my secondary school STEM teaching and I am currently pursuing advanced training in Curriculum and Teaching. My academic and professional interests include experiential learning, STEM pedagogy, curriculum innovation, life skills education, and Global Citizenship Education (GCE). I strongly believe that STEM education should not only build technical knowledge, but also problem-solving skills, creativity and creative thinking, collaboration, and responsible citizenship.

## WHAT I DO

*As the Chief Analyst of SkillAhead Solutions Ltd, I provide consulting and training services for businesses and mentor aspiring analysts.*

**✅ Hands-On STEM Teaching & Facilitation.**

I design and deliver practical, learner-centred STEM lessons in Physics and Mathematics using:
- Inquiry-based learning
- Project-based and problem-based learning
- Real-world demonstrations and experiments
- Scaffolded instruction for diverse learner abilities

My focus is on helping learners build understanding through doing, not memorisation. 

**✅ Curriculum Implementation & Instructional Design.**

I implement national and school curricula while enriching them with:
- Hands-on activities and experiments
- Contextualised examples relevant to learners’ environments
- Clear learning objectives and competency-based assessment
- Safety-conscious classroom and workshop practices

I design schemes of work, lesson plans, modules, and learner activities aligned to measurable outcomes. 

**✅ Learning Materials & Project Development.**

I develop and document:
- Conceptualised and experiential learning materials (CELMs)
- Practical classroom experiments using low-cost, locally available materials
-Student project guides and assessment rubrics
-Learning reflections and improvement notes

These materials are designed to help learners create verifiable artefacts and build confidence in STEM skills. 

**✅ Learner Assessment & Documentation.**

I track learner progress through:
- Practical demonstrations and observations
- Continuous assessment and feedback
- Photo and video documentation of student work
- Reflective notes on learner growth and challenges

I value evidence-based teaching, where learning outcomes are visible and measurable.

**✅ Life Skills, GCE & SDGs Education.**

Beyond technical content, I integrate:
- Life skills education
- Global Citizenship Education (GCE)
- Teaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
- Values of teamwork, responsibility, safety, and ethical decision-making

This prepares learners not just for exams, but for life, work, and community leadership.

**✅ Community Engagement & Mentorship.**

I actively support:
- Science clubs and student exhibitions
- School and community STEM activities
- Youth mentorship and leadership development
- Collaborative learning environments

I believe learning is strongest when schools, families, and communities are involved.

**✅ Continuous Learning & Reflection.**

This GitHub space also serves as:
- A learning journal for new STEM teaching ideas
- A repository for improving and refining resources
- A platform for sharing best practices with fellow educators

I am committed to continuous professional growth, experimentation, and improvement.
